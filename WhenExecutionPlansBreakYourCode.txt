# Introduction:

I'm currently going through Itzik Ben-Gan's book (//TODO: insert book name here) and we've reached the stage where we're going through 
the "WITH RESULT SETS" (//TODO: insert link to Docs).

Now, to be honest, I've never seen them in the wild. I think that this is mainly just because I am not fond of stored procedures that output two different result sets.

That's not the point of this blog post though. The point of this blog post is to show you how to quickly rename the columns from a stored procedure and, if you've read the first 2 sentences, you know that we're going to be doing this using WITH RESULT SETS

# Isn't She Lovely:

I'm running this on (//TODO: insert version info of SQL Server) and I'm running the following code as examples.

```TSQL
//TODO: insert TSQL code to check SQL version
//TODO: insert TSQL code to create tables and stored procedures.
```

//TODO: insert screenshot of version info 

# Signed, Sealed, Delivered:

As I said, we're going to be using WITH RESULT SETS to rename the output columns of a stored procedure.

```TSQL
TODO: show the use of WITH RESULT SET to show renaming stored procedure results
```

//TODO: insert screenshot of WRS renaming stored procedure results

# Uptight:

SURPRISE!

Now imagine my surprise when, going through the examples in the book, I run the above code and receive an error message

//TODO: insert error message snippit

//TODO: insert error message screenshot.

So I turn back to the book and read the next line "[...] once that has completed successfully[...]" 
Huh, what? Completed successfully?

So I run through my checklist
- Have I missed a previous step? No.
- Have I messed up a previous step? No.
- Have I run things out of order. No.
- Have I accidently only run part of the script. No.

Nothing is jumping out at me so I go off script. What's the error message saying? 
Difference in columns? That's not making any sense.

I quickly write out the two SELECT statements and run them separately. They execute without problems.
I start switching through the different panels and suddenly something pops out at me.

```quote
(1 row affected)
(1 row affected)
(1 row affected)
(1 row affected)
```
# For Once In My Life:

In case you're wondering, I'm not running the SELECT statements twice. Here's the same messages with reference to what is causing them:

```quote
(1 row affected) <-- dbo.Header
(1 row affected) <-- Actual Execution Plan
(1 row affected) <-- dbo.Header2
(1 row affected) <-- Actual Execution Plan
```

I turn off Actual Execution Plans and everything is working again!


So I start reading the error message and it's not making any sense for me. The columns are exactly the a

# Master Blaster:

In case you are worried about this happening to you, don't be!
I was runnning this on (//TODO: insert version info of SQL Server) and I tried to verify the behaviour.
Nope! No problem! That's the second thing that I've found naturally that's been fixed in newer versions of SQL Server (//TODO: insert link to Grant Fritchey Dr.Who post).
