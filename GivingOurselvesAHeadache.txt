Let's Give Ourselves A Headache!

We're going to create a generic stored procedure that's only going to do 3 things.

Create a table if it does not exist,
Insert the value of the parameter into the table, and
Spit the value back out from the table.

Sounds simple right? Let's see how we can cause ourselves some pain.

When we write the code for the stored procedure, and before we execute it, we can see a lot of
red squiggly text around the name of the stored procedure and the name of the table.

Thanks to the joy that is Deferred Name Resolution (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-procedure-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017#limitations-and-restrictions)
that allows us to create a stored procedure on tables that do not exist just yet.
